> 📊 A **business-focused data analytics project** using SQL to analyze Uber trip data, uncover operational insights, revenue patterns, demand trends, and surge-pricing behavior for decision-making.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to use **SQL as a decision-making tool**, not just for querying data.

This analysis answers real business questions such as:

* When does Uber experience peak demand?
* Which routes generate the highest revenue?
* How does surge pricing affect trip cost and demand?
* What patterns influence trip duration and distance?

---

## 🧠 Business Questions Answered

This project focuses on **practical, interview-relevant insights**, including:

* 🚕 Peak pickup hours and high-demand time windows
* 📍 Top pickup and drop-off locations by trip volume
* 💰 Revenue contribution by distance, time, and surge pricing
* 📈 Average fare trends and trip duration analysis
* ⚠️ Identification of high-surge zones and times
* 🧮 Passenger count vs fare and distance relationship

Each query is written to **simulate real analytics tasks** performed by data analysts in ride-sharing companies.

---

## 📘 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains anonymized Uber trip records with fields such as:

* Trip ID
* Pickup Time & Drop-off Time
* Passenger Count
* Trip Distance
* Pickup Location ID (PU)
* Drop-off Location ID (DO)
* Fare Amount
* Surge Fee

This structure enables **time-based, location-based, and revenue-based analysis**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **SQL** (CTEs, aggregations, joins, case statements, time functions)
* **Relational Database** (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible syntax)
* **Business Intelligence Thinking**
* **Analytical Query Design**

---

## 📊 Key SQL Techniques Used

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Time-based analysis (hour, day, peak vs off-peak)
* Aggregations (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
* Conditional logic (`CASE WHEN`)
* Revenue and demand segmentation
* Performance-focused analytical queries

## 🔍 Sample Insights (Highlights)

* Peak demand occurs during **evening office hours and late-night windows**
* Surge pricing significantly increases **average trip revenue** during high-demand periods
* Certain pickup-dropoff pairs consistently generate **higher fare per kilometer**
* Trips with moderate distance and surge fees contribute the most to total revenue
